      <description>Summary An experienced data scientist with a diverse background and a strong technical skill set, I have experience working both internationally and domestically in industries such as development, telecommunications and finance.
A keen statistical programmer, I will be a keynote speaker at the useR! conference in Brisbane in July 2018.
 Education Master of Computer Science (Current)
