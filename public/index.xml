      <description>I started a new job last week. On day 2, the boss said to me “What do you know about transport and GIS?”, to which I gamely replied (with more honesty than career sense) “nothing!”
So here I am working on transport and GIS.
She who brags about being a fast learner in interviews reaps what she sows.
As it turns out, both transport and GIS are awesome. But how do you get up to speed really, really quickly?</description>

      <description>Introduction R is a growing, vibrant programming language. Originally created by Ihaka and Gentleman in the 1990s, what was a niche experimental language is now in mainstream usage across many disciplines and domains (Ihaka, 1998).
One thing that Ihaka and Gentleman may not have intended at the time was the fact that R is no longer just a programming language. Users of R are developing into a distinct programming subculture at the intersection of multiple domains.</description>

      <description>I had the opportunity to talk at the CPA Emerging Leaders Conference today in Melbourne, then again next week in Sydney. It was a great crowd with a really interesting mix of perspectives.
I was talking about Creating data driven value and insights, which was aimed at showing an already very data literate group of people (accountants!) how to get started with data driven thinking.
My thoughts on getting started come down to five things:</description>

      <description>The data revolution is upon us! Or at least that’s what someone with a snappy grasp of copy-editing and a mandate for clicks would say.
There’s a common misperception that’s out there in the data world that only some of us know how to be data driven. Only some of us have our data driving licenses and can get behind the wheel.
This is manifestly false. Even if you don’t know R or Python or any other part of the common data science toolkit (yet), there are things you can do and start to think about today as you begin to embrace the idea of data-driven decision making.</description>

      <description>Automating a consulting project workflow There’s been a great deal of really useful work around data science workflows in the last couple of years and if you’ve followed Jenny Bryan’s work at all, you’ll know exactly what I mean.
In consulting, the data science workflow is also critical, but it’s wrapped up with some extra management challenges. In addition to code and data, there’s a series of documents, people and timing to manage.</description>

      <description>Summary An experienced data scientist with a diverse background and a strong technical skill set, I have experience working both internationally and domestically in industries such as development, telecommunications and finance.
A keen statistical programmer, I will be a keynote speaker at the useR! conference in Brisbane in July 2018.
 Education Master of Computer Science (Current)
I’m currently exploring forecasting in high dimensional data sets and exploring whether agent-based (AI) approaches can provide a robust method of managing massive numbers of time series with a view to submitting a masters’ thesis on the topic.</description>

      <description>If you’re a rural data scientist, then sooner or later you’ve had to move a big file to the cloud or back. That’s a world of pain right there.
If you know anything about how information is transmitted via the internet, you know that files are broken into packets, sent, then reassembled on the other side. If packets go missing, the computer requests resends until the file is fully assembled, or until the system times out.</description>

      <description>I often take on pro bono work for organisations that need help developing a data strategy or delivering a data science project. The kinds of things I do for not for profits include advice on research design, analysis, modelling, or training data analysts.
I may not always be able to say yes, but if you’re a not for profit or research group who need a hand, please don’t hesitate to ask.</description>
