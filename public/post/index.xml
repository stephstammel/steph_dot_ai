      <description>bibliography stuff https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html  Introduction  Not just a language R is a developing subculture, as well as a developing, dynamic programming language.
This subculture is at the intersection of a very broad array of fields and provides a communication medium for them, as well as a marketplace for the exchange of ideas.
Evidence of culture:
* Coleman&amp;#39;s _Hacker Culture_ observed specificaly in Debian open source communities. E.g. not unique to R.</description>

      <description>I had the opportunity to talk at the CPA Emerging Leaders Conference today in Melbourne, then again next week in Sydney. It was a great crowd with a really interesting mix of perspectives.
I was talking about Creating data driven value and insights, which was aimed at showing an already very data literate group of people (accountants!) how to get started with data driven thinking.
My thoughts on getting started come down to five things:</description>

      <description>The data revolution is upon us! Or at least that’s what someone with a snappy grasp of copy-editing and a mandate for clicks would say.
There’s a common misperception that’s out there in the data world that only some of us know how to be data driven. Only some of us have our data driving licenses and can get behind the wheel.
This is manifestly false. Even if you don’t know R or Python or any other part of the common data science toolkit (yet), there are things you can do and start to think about today as you begin to embrace the idea of data-driven decision making.</description>

      <description>Automating a consulting project workflow There’s been a great deal of really useful work around data science workflows in the last couple of years and if you’ve followed Jenny Bryan’s work at all, you’ll know exactly what I mean.
In consulting, the data science workflow is also critical, but it’s wrapped up with some extra management challenges. In addition to code and data, there’s a series of documents, people and timing to manage.</description>

      <description>If you’re a rural data scientist, then sooner or later you’ve had to move a big file to the cloud or back. That’s a world of pain right there.
If you know anything about how information is transmitted via the internet, you know that files are broken into packets, sent, then reassembled on the other side. If packets go missing, the computer requests resends until the file is fully assembled, or until the system times out.</description>
