<p>I often take on pro bono work for organisations that need help developing a data strategy or delivering a data science project. The kinds of things I do for not for profits include advice on research design, analysis, modelling, or training data analysts.</p>
<p>I may not always be able to say yes, but if you’re a not for profit or research group who need a hand, please don’t hesitate to ask.</p>
<p>If I can’t help, I may be able to help you find someone who can.</p>
