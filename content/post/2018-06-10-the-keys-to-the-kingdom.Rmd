I started a new job last week- here I am working on transport and GIS! 

As it turns out, both transport and GIS are _awesome_. But how do you get up to speed really, really quickly?

You ask for help.

In return, I was given the keys to the kingdom - people to follow, blog posts to explore, books to read, offers of help. This community is _amazing_.

The resources were too good not to share and following [Steph Locke's geospatial lead on this](https://itsalocke.com/blog/r-spatial-resources/), here's the summary. I've also added a few I found on my own.

# Great people to follow

One of the ways I get a good overall view of a topic is by following great people on Twitter. Having a feed that offers me a little new information every day means I'm learning continuously - with context.

The people recommended to me for following include:

[Elaine McVey (multiple times)](https://twitter.com/eamcvey)

[Civic Angela (who is fighting the patriarchy one spontaneous conference talk at a time AND just graduated!)](https://twitter.com/CivicAngela)

[Robin Lovelace, who wrote two of the books I'll link to below. I'm up to Chapter 5 of the microsimulation book and it is an excellent starter's guide. Highly recommended!](https://twitter.com/robinlovelace)

[Reka S, who was at this year's Seattle Unconference and by report an all-round super star.](https://twitter.com/r_solymosi)

[Oliver Obrien, who tweets about cities](https://twitter.com/oobr)

[Mark Padgham, bike expert](https://twitter.com/bikesRdata)

[Michael Sumner, #rstats GIS nice guy](https://twitter.com/mdsumner) who was the first person I ever asked about GIS stuff and came through in spades for a complete twitter stranger. It was my first introduction to what this community can be like.

[Belinda Maher, Aussie transport maven](https://twitter.com/mingabelle).

[Alon Levy, transport writer](https://twitter.com/alon_levy).

[Mastodon C, I think he's/she/they is a cities person?](https://twitter.com/MastodonC)

[Jarret Walker, author of human transit](https://twitter.com/humantransit).

# Packages to explore

[gtfsr, a package for doing things with gtfs data.](https://github.com/ropensci/gtfsr) Also, for the record, I found out that gtfs is a type of transport data and does not stand for ["go the @#$% to sleep" in this context (language warning on this link!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Udj-o2m39NA).

[stplanr, by Robin Lovelace and Richard Ellison.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stplanr/vignettes/stplanr-paper.html) A package full of useful transport functions and ideas.

[RNetlogo for Agent Based Modelling](http://rnetlogo.r-forge.r-project.org).

[NetLogoR](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/NetLogoR).

Not an R package: [The Multi-Agent Transport Simulation MATSim](http://www.oapen.org/search?identifier=613715). As far as I can ascertain there is no R wrapper for this Java-based piece of open source magic. We may need to do something about that...

# Books to read

[Spatial Microsimulation in R](http://spatial-microsim-book.robinlovelace.net) by Robin Lovelace. I got through five chapters or so of this already and it's an excellent starter's guide.

[Geocomputation in R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net) by Lovelace, Nowosad and Muenchow. Forthcoming, but looks fantastic.

[Agent-Based Models of Geographical Systems](http://www.casa.ucl.ac.uk/ABM.pdf) by Heppenstall, Crooks, See and Batty, editors.

[Forecasting Urban Travel](https://www.ebooks.com/1997057/forecasting-urban-travel/boyce-d-e-williams-h-c-w-l/) by Boyce and Williams. This one is not free, but I have a feeling I'm going to get acquainted with it in the future.

[Modelling Transport](https://www.amazon.com.au/Modelling-Transport-Juan-Dios-Ortúzar-ebook/dp/B005CPJU5Y) by Ortuzar and Willumsen, ditto.

[Handbook of Choice Modelling](https://www.e-elgar.com/shop/handbook-of-choice-modelling?___website=us_warehouse#none), again not free. But then the funding to produce these kinds of works has to come from somewhere, right?

# Blogs and articles

[Todd Schneider on the NYC subway countdown clock](http://toddwschneider.com/posts/nyc-subway-data-analysis/)

[Steve Bennett's blog](https://stevebennett.me)

[Visualising GTFS data in R](https://rpubs.com/data_feelings/data607_gtfs) by DataFeelings

Not R, but some great [Open Cities projects and blogs](https://carto.com/blog/forty-brilliant-open-data-projects-preparing-smart-cities-2018/).


# Talks to watch

[This talk by Katie Bell on Sydney Buses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7jqU39wvKk)

# Papers largely trapped behind paywalls (sorry!)

These are mostly about choice modelling, which is where I have alot of interest at the moment. A short pay-walled bibliography if you will.

# People to thank

I got an amazing list of resources to learn in a very short period of time, because of the help and assistance of the R Community. Thankyou so much to you all!
