<p>I started a new job last week- here I am working on transport and GIS!</p>
<p>As it turns out, both transport and GIS are <em>awesome</em>. But how do you get up to speed really, really quickly?</p>
<p>You ask for help.</p>

</div>
<p>In return, I was given the keys to the kingdom - people to follow, blog posts to explore, books to read, offers of help. This community is <em>amazing</em>.</p>
<p>The resources were too good not to share and following <a href="https://itsalocke.com/blog/r-spatial-resources/">Steph Locke’s geospatial lead on this</a>, here’s the summary. I’ve also added a few I found on my own.</p>
<div id="great-people-to-follow" class="section level1">
<h1>Great people to follow</h1>
<p>One of the ways I get a good overall view of a topic is by following great people on Twitter. Having a feed that offers me a little new information every day means I’m learning continuously - with context.</p>
<p>The people recommended to me for following include:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/eamcvey">Elaine McVey (multiple times)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/CivicAngela">Civic Angela (who is fighting the patriarchy one spontaneous conference talk at a time AND just graduated!)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/robinlovelace">Robin Lovelace, who wrote two of the books I’ll link to below. I’m up to Chapter 5 of the microsimulation book and it is an excellent starter’s guide. Highly recommended!</a></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/r_solymosi">Reka S, who was at this year’s Seattle Unconference and by report an all-round super star.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/oobr">Oliver Obrien, who tweets about cities</a></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bikesRdata">Mark Padgham, bike expert</a></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mdsumner">Michael Sumner, #rstats GIS nice guy</a> who was the first person I ever asked about GIS stuff and came through in spades for a complete twitter stranger. It was my first introduction to what this community can be like.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mingabelle">Belinda Maher, Aussie transport maven</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/alon_levy">Alon Levy, transport writer</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MastodonC">Mastodon C, I think he’s/she/they is a cities person?</a></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/humantransit">Jarret Walker, author of human transit</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="packages-to-explore" class="section level1">
<h1>Packages to explore</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ropensci/gtfsr">gtfsr, a package for doing things with gtfs data.</a> Also, for the record, I found out that gtfs is a type of transport data and does not stand for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Udj-o2m39NA">“go the @#$% to sleep” in this context (language warning on this link!)</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stplanr/vignettes/stplanr-paper.html">stplanr, by Robin Lovelace and Richard Ellison.</a> A package full of useful transport functions and ideas.</p>
<p><a href="http://rnetlogo.r-forge.r-project.org">RNetlogo for Agent Based Modelling</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/NetLogoR">NetLogoR</a>.</p>
<p>Not an R package: <a href="http://www.oapen.org/search?identifier=613715">The Multi-Agent Transport Simulation MATSim</a>. As far as I can ascertain there is no R wrapper for this Java-based piece of open source magic. We may need to do something about that…</p>
</div>
<div id="books-to-read" class="section level1">
<h1>Books to read</h1>
<p><a href="http://spatial-microsim-book.robinlovelace.net">Spatial Microsimulation in R</a> by Robin Lovelace. I got through five chapters or so of this already and it’s an excellent starter’s guide.</p>
<p><a href="https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net">Geocomputation in R</a> by Lovelace, Nowosad and Muenchow. Forthcoming, but looks fantastic.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Modelling-Transport-Juan-Dios-Ortúzar-ebook/dp/B005CPJU5Y">Modelling Transport</a> by Ortuzar and Willumsen, ditto.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.e-elgar.com/shop/handbook-of-choice-modelling?___website=us_warehouse#none">Handbook of Choice Modelling</a>, again not free. But then the funding to produce these kinds of works has to come from somewhere, right?</p>

<div id="people-to-thank" class="section level1">
<h1>People to thank</h1>
<p>I got an amazing list of resources to learn in a very short period of time, because of the help and assistance of the R Community. Thankyou so much to you all!</p>
